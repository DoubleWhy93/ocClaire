Nova Cascadia sprawls along what was once the Pacific Northwest, a megacity of neon-drenched towers and rain-slicked streets. After the Consciousness Breakthrough of 2089, the human mind became just another data format — uploadable, downloadable, editable.

The wealthy live twice: once in flesh, once in the Lattice, a digital paradise maintained by Meridian Corp. The poor sell fragments of their memories to scrape by, haunted by gaps they can't explain. Between these extremes, a thriving grey market trades in consciousness modifications — borrowed skills, suppressed traumas, stolen experiences.

The city's districts tell its story: the gleaming corporate Spires above, the bustling Midlevels where most people live and work, and the Undergrid below, where rogue netrunners and consciousness hackers operate beyond Meridian's reach. Tensions are rising. Rumors spread of a consciousness virus that could unravel the Lattice itself.
