Aethermoor was once a single vast continent, unified under the Crystal Accord. Then came the Sundering — a cataclysmic war between rival mage-houses that shattered the land into floating islands, each tethered to the world by crystalline ley lines that pulse with raw magical energy.

Now, centuries later, the islands drift in an endless sky. Some have grown into thriving city-states, their spires reaching toward sister-islands above. Others have withered, their ley lines dimming, their people scattered. The great mage-houses still vie for control, but a new generation questions whether the old ways must endure.

Between the islands, skyships navigate treacherous aether currents, carrying merchants, mercenaries, and those seeking a fresh start on distant shores. Below, the Underdrift — the scarred surface of the old world — remains largely unexplored, a place of ruins and wild magic where the desperate and the brave make their homes.
