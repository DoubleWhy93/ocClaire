Crystallis was everything Duskhollow wasn't: bright, proud, and utterly convinced of its own importance.

The island floated higher than any other in the archipelago, tethered to the world by three massive ley lines that blazed with steady white light. Its spires — grown from living crystal over centuries by the Arcane College's most talented shapers — caught the sunlight and scattered it into rainbows that danced across the streets below. The air tasted clean, almost sweet, carrying none of the industrial tang of Ironhaven or the fading salt of Duskhollow.

Lyra hated it immediately.

"Bit much, isn't it?" Kael said, shading his eyes as they stepped off the ferry onto Crystallis's immaculate marble docks. He'd insisted on coming — something about repaying a life-debt, though Lyra suspected he mostly wanted to get off Ironhaven before Maren's people found him again.

"The whole island is a performance," Lyra said. "Three primary ley lines, all Class A, and they use most of that energy to make their buildings sparkle."

"You can tell all that just by looking?"

She tapped the side of her sextant case. "I can tell by measuring. Crystallis burns through more ley energy in a day than Duskhollow uses in a month. And they wonder why the outer islands are dimming."

Elder Thorne's letter of passage got them through the College's outer gates, past the student dormitories and lecture halls, into the administrative wing where a clerk with spectacles and an expression of profound disinterest reviewed their credentials.

"The restricted archives," the clerk repeated, as if Lyra had requested access to the sun. "For cartographic research."

"Historical survey data. Pre-Sundering ley line measurements." Lyra kept her voice steady. "Elder Thorne's seal should verify my authorization."

The clerk turned the letter over twice, held it up to the light, and finally stamped it with an expression suggesting he'd rather be doing literally anything else. "Third sub-basement. Section Twelve. You have until closing bell. Touch nothing that glows."

The restricted archives were exactly what Lyra had hoped and feared: vast, poorly organized, and clearly untouched for decades.

Row upon row of crystal storage matrices lined the walls, each one containing compressed data from the old surveys — measurements taken in the centuries before the Sundering, when Aethermoor had been one continuous landmass and the ley lines had run through it like veins through a body.

"So," Kael said, peering at a matrix that pulsed with faint blue light, "what exactly are we looking for?"

"Baseline measurements. What the ley lines looked like when they were healthy — before anyone broke the continent apart." Lyra was already pulling matrices from the shelves, holding them up to her sextant's lenses one at a time. "If I can compare the pre-Sundering patterns to what I'm seeing now..."

"You'll know why they're failing."

"Maybe. Or at least I'll know *how* they're failing, which is a start."

They worked in silence for two hours. Kael proved unexpectedly useful — his navigator's training meant he could read coordinate systems quickly, and he organized the matrices into chronological order while Lyra focused on the measurements themselves.

It was Kael who found it.

"Lyra." His voice had changed — gone flat and careful, the way it did when he talked about the *Windreaver*. "Come look at this."

The matrix he held was older than the others, its crystal clouded with age. But the data inside was clear enough. It showed a map of Aethermoor — whole, unified, as it had been before the Sundering — with every ley line marked in precise detail.

And beneath the ley lines, something else. A deeper network, rendered in red, that Lyra had never seen on any chart.

"What is that?" Kael whispered.

Lyra's hands trembled as she adjusted her sextant's lenses. The red network wasn't ley lines. It was something underneath them — something the ley lines were *connected* to. A root system beneath the roots.

"I don't know," she said. "But I think my mentor did. I think this is what he was looking for when he went to the Underdrift."

She photographed every matrix in the section. As they left the archives, she noticed something that made her stomach drop: the crystal matrices they'd handled had been coated in a fine layer of dust — undisturbed for years.

Except for one shelf, where the dust had been disturbed recently. Someone else had been here. Someone looking at the same data.

The closing bell rang, and they hurried toward the exit.

Behind them, in the shadows of Section Twelve, a small crystal embedded in the wall pulsed once — a silent alarm that had been waiting, very patiently, for someone to come looking.
