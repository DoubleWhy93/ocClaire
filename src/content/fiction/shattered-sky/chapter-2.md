Ironhaven smelled like rust and ambition.

Lyra stepped off the inter-island ferry onto a dock slick with condensation from the foundries that lined the waterfront. Steam rose from a dozen industrial chimneys, mixing with the natural mist of the aether currents to create a haze that turned the afternoon sun into a pale copper disk.

She pulled her coat tighter and consulted her map. The ferry to Crystallis didn't leave until morning, which meant a night in Ironhaven — a prospect that excited her about as much as a root canal. The island was Aethermoor's industrial heart, a place where everything had a price and nothing had charm.

Still, she needed supplies. Her modified sextant needed new lenses, and old Pek's shop on Anvil Street was the only place in the archipelago that carried the right grade of crystal.

She found the shop easily enough, wedged between a chandler and a pawnbroker in Ironhaven's lower market district. Pek — a wiry woman of indeterminate age with crystal dust permanently embedded in her fingertips — examined Lyra's sextant with professional interest.

"Edric's design," Pek said, not a question.

"You knew him?"

"Sold him the lenses. Ten years ago, maybe twelve." Pek held the sextant up to the light, squinting through its primary lens. "He was trying to see things the standard instruments couldn't. Frequencies below the visible spectrum."

"Did it work?"

Pek set the sextant down carefully. "He stopped coming to buy lenses. Draw your own conclusions." She rummaged behind her counter. "I can refit this with second-harmonic crystal. Give you about twenty percent better resolution in the amber range. Take me till morning."

"That's perfect. I need to catch the Crystallis ferry anyway."

"Crystallis." Pek's eyebrows rose. "Fancy company for a Duskhollow girl."

Lyra paid the deposit and stepped back into the haze. She had hours to kill and nowhere in particular to be — a combination that, in Ironhaven, inevitably led to the docks.

That's where she found Kael Ashborne.

The fight was already in progress when Lyra rounded the corner onto Berth Street. A tall man with sun-bleached hair was backed against the wall of the Broken Anchor tavern, holding a bar stool like a shield while three dockworkers closed in. One of them held a knife that caught the lamplight in an ugly way.

"Look," the tall man said, his voice carrying the easy drawl of someone accustomed to talking through bad situations, "I fully acknowledge that I owe Maren for the cargo. But killing me seems counterproductive to the whole *getting paid* arrangement."

"Maren's tired of waiting," said the one with the knife. "Says if you can't pay in coin, you can pay in parts."

"That's a terrible exchange rate."

The knife-holder lunged. The tall man swung the stool — too slow. The blade caught his forearm, drawing a line of red, and he stumbled back against the wall with a sound more frustrated than frightened.

Lyra didn't think. She pulled the emergency flare from her satchel — standard equipment for anyone who worked near ley lines — and cracked it against the cobblestones. A shriek of white-blue light erupted upward, blinding in the haze.

The dockworkers recoiled. In the confusion, Lyra grabbed the tall man's unwounded arm and pulled.

"Run," she said.

"Don't have to tell me twice."

They ran through the lower market, dodging between carts and startled pedestrians, until the shouts behind them faded. Lyra pulled him into a narrow alley between two warehouses and pressed them both flat against the wall, breathing hard.

"You just saved my life," the man said, wrapping a strip torn from his shirt around his bleeding arm. He was grinning, which struck Lyra as inappropriate given the circumstances. "Kael Ashborne. Former captain of the *Windreaver*. Current fugitive from debt collectors, apparently."

"Lyra Voss. Cartographer." She peered around the corner. The alley was clear. "You should get that arm looked at."

"It's a scratch. I've had worse from my navigation console." He flexed his fingers experimentally and winced. "Okay, maybe a medium scratch." He studied her. "A cartographer with emergency flares. Not many of those around."

"Ley line work. You need flares for when the readings go wrong."

"Ah." Something shifted in his expression — a flicker of recognition, maybe. Or pain. "Ley lines. Right."

She would learn, later, about the *Windreaver*. About the night the ley line vanished and his ship fell into the dark. About the three names he carried like stones in his pockets.

But that night in Ironhaven, all she knew was that she'd pulled a stranger out of a knife fight, and now he was looking at her emergency flare satchel like it contained the answer to a question he'd been afraid to ask.

"Buy you a drink?" he said. "Somewhere with fewer people who want to kill me?"

Against her better judgment, she said yes.
