The ley line beneath Duskhollow flickered twice before dawn, and Lyra Voss felt each pulse like a stuttering heartbeat in her own chest.

She pressed her palm against the observation platform's crystal floor, ignoring the cold that seeped through her gloves. Below, the familiar blue-white glow of the island's primary vein had taken on a sickly amber tinge. She'd been tracking the discoloration for weeks now, filling page after page of her journal with measurements that told a story no one wanted to hear.

"It's getting worse," she murmured.

The wind answered, carrying the salt-and-ozone smell of the aether currents that flowed between the islands. From this height, she could see three neighboring islands: Ironhaven's industrial sprawl to the east, the agricultural terraces of Greenveil to the south, and far to the north, barely visible through the morning haze, the gleaming spires of Crystallis — seat of the Arcane College and the closest thing Aethermoor had to a capital.

Duskhollow hung between them, growing dimmer by the day.

She checked her sextant — the modified one, fitted with lenses her mentor had ground from salvaged ley crystals. The readings confirmed what her instincts already knew: the island's primary ley line was operating at sixty-two percent capacity. Last month it had been sixty-eight. The month before, seventy-four.

At this rate, Duskhollow would go dark within the year.

"You know," said a voice from behind her, "most people watch sunrises for enjoyment."

Lyra didn't turn. She recognized Elder Thorne's measured footsteps, the soft tap of his walking staff against crystal. The old man had been the island's administrator for three decades, and he moved through Duskhollow like he was part of its architecture.

"The sunrise is fine," Lyra said. "It's what's happening beneath it that worries me."

Thorne joined her at the railing, his white beard catching the early light. He gazed down at the amber-tinged vein without expression. "The College says fluctuations are normal. Part of the natural cycle."

"The College hasn't sent anyone to actually *look* in fourteen years." Lyra pulled her journal from her satchel and flipped to a chart she'd spent the previous night compiling. "These aren't fluctuations, Elder. It's a decline. Steady, measurable, and accelerating."

Thorne studied the chart with the careful attention of a man who understood numbers even if he didn't understand the magic behind them. After a long moment, he handed the journal back.

"What would you have me do, Lyra? Evacuate? Based on the charts of one cartographer?"

"Based on the charts of *two* cartographers," she corrected quietly. "My mentor saw this starting before he—" She stopped. Swallowed. "Before he disappeared."

The old man's expression softened. "Edric was brilliant. And troubled. The Underdrift claimed many good people during the expedition years."

"He wasn't troubled. He was *right*."

Silence stretched between them. Below, the ley line flickered again — a brief dimming that made the observation platform shudder beneath their feet. A flock of aethergulls erupted from the island's edge, shrieking.

Thorne gripped the railing. "That's happening more frequently."

"Every three days now." Lyra met his eyes. "It used to be every ten."

The elder was quiet for a long time. Then: "What do you need?"

"A letter of passage. Something with an official seal that will get me into the Arcane College's restricted archives." She'd rehearsed this request a dozen times, but her voice still wavered. "If the ley lines are failing, the answer is in the old surveys — the ones from before the Sundering. No one's studied them in centuries."

"The College guards those archives jealously."

"Which is why I need the letter."

Thorne looked out at the dimming vein one last time, then nodded slowly. "You'll have it by midday. But Lyra — be careful in Crystallis. The mage-houses play games that cartographers aren't equipped for."

Lyra tucked her journal away and allowed herself a small smile. "Then it's a good thing I'm not just a cartographer."

She was halfway to the lift when the ley line flickered a third time, and the entire island dropped six inches before the vein steadied. Behind her, she heard Elder Thorne's sharp intake of breath.

She didn't look back. There wasn't time.
