Kael once commanded the *Windreaver*, one of the fastest courier ships in the Aethermoor trade lanes. That ended the night his ship crashed into the Underdrift, killing three of his crew and destroying a cargo of crystalline resonators worth more than most islands.

The official report blamed pilot error. Kael knows the truth is worse: the ley line his navigation charts said was stable had simply *vanished*, mid-flight, without warning. No one believed him. The Merchant Guild stripped his license, and the families of his dead crew want answers he can't give.

When Lyra Voss saved him from a bar fight in Ironhaven (and a debt collector's knife), he found himself dragged into her quest to understand the dying ley lines. He tells himself he's just repaying the debt. The truth is, she's the only person who believes the lines are failing — and that means she's the only one who might prove he's not a murderer.

## Skills

A gifted navigator and pilot, Kael can coax speed from any skyship ever built. He's a decent swordsman, a better card player, and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Aethermoor's trade routes, smuggling lanes, and port towns. He also has a talent for talking his way out of situations his mouth talked him into.
