Nobody knows Zero's birth name — least of all Zero. They woke up three years ago in a rented body in the Undergrid with no memories, no identity, and a skull full of consciousness modifications that shouldn't exist. Whoever they were before, someone had gone to extraordinary lengths to erase them.

Zero makes a living in Nova Cascadia's grey market, performing consciousness modifications for clients who can't afford — or can't trust — Meridian Corp's official clinics. Memory suppression, skill grafts, personality smoothing. They're good at it, unnervingly good, with an intuitive understanding of consciousness architecture that surprises even veteran netrunners.

But some nights, fragments surface. A face. A voice. The smell of rain on hot concrete. And always, always, the feeling that they're running out of time to remember something critical.

## Abilities

Zero can interface directly with consciousness data without standard neural bridges — an ability that should be impossible. They can read and modify memory structures by touch, diagnose corruption in consciousness backups, and navigate the Lattice without a jack. These abilities make them invaluable to their clients and terrifying to Meridian Corp.
