Lyra grew up on the withering island of Duskhollow, watching its ley line dim a little more each year. While others fled to brighter shores, she stayed, convinced the island could be saved if someone understood *why* the lines were dying.

She apprenticed under the last Cartographer of Duskhollow, learning to read the crystalline veins that connected the islands. When her mentor vanished during an expedition to the Underdrift, Lyra inherited both his maps and his obsession.

Now she travels between islands, charting ley lines no one else can see, chasing a theory that the Sundering didn't just break the land — it broke something deeper. Something that's still unraveling.

## Abilities

Lyra possesses a rare sensitivity to ley line energy. She can feel the pulse of crystalline veins through solid rock, and her hand-drawn maps reveal patterns invisible to magical instruments. She carries a modified sextant that measures aetheric density, and a journal filled with equations that even the Arcane College finds unsettling.

## Relationships

- **Kael Ashborne** — Her reluctant traveling companion, a disgraced skyship captain who owes her a life-debt.
- **The Archivist** — A mysterious figure who sends her coded messages about ley line anomalies.
